Milestone 2: Retrieval component

At least the following queries should be used to test your retrieval:

1 – cristina lopes

2 - machine learning

3 - ACM

4 - master of software engineering

Developing the Search component
Once you have built the inverted index, you are ready to test document retrieval with queries. At the very least, the search should be able to deal with boolean queries: AND only. If you wish, you can sort the retrieved documents based on tf-idf scoring (you are not required to do so now, but it will be required for the final search engine).  

Deliverables: Submit your code and a report (in PDF format) with the following content:

the top 5 URLs for each of the queries above
a screenshot of your search interface in action (text or web-based)
No late submissions will be accepted for this milestone.

Evaluation criteria:

Did your report show up on time?
Are the reported URLs plausible?
Important note: You can only change teams between the milestones of Assignment 3 if there are strong reasons for doing so. Please, write an email to the teaching team explaining why you need to change teams and we will assess your situation.
